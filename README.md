<h2><b>Hey there! 🌟</b></h2>

<p>I'm Phuong, a third-year Interaction Design and Software Development student at Auckland University of Technology New Zealand. <br />

Outside of study, I enjoy hiking, food, and travelling, but what motives me most are design: UX/UI, branding, and coding. 
To me, design is the process of transforming problems into meaningful solutions and ideas into tangible experiences. It's driven by:
- 🤔 curiosity
- 👯 user research
- 🫶🏼 empathy
- ☀️ creativity</p>

<p>My main tech stack is HTML, CSS, JAVA, JAVASCRIPT, REACT. My favourite tools are Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator and Figma.</p>

<p>I've got a bunch of pinned projects, but my favorite is the Simon Game.<br /></p>


<h3>Fun facts:</h3>

<li> I don't like chocolate and coffee</li>
<li> I like hiking</li>
</ul>
